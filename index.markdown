        <p>I am a media researcher, interested in the social role of anonymity and the prevention of online harassment. I will be joining the University of Maryland iSchool as a PhD student this fall. <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/assets/documents/research/msc-dissertations/2019/Dibella.pdf">“The Uncertain Decorum of Online Identification”</a> contains my MSc dissertation research.
